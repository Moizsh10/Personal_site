				<h1>Meowdy!</h1>
				<p>Welcome to my cozy little corner of the web! My name is Moiz a.k.a Moizsh10 a.k.a DapperCat10 a.k.a SnappDragon10 depending on where you know me from. Yes, I really like the number Ten.</p>
				
				<p>For the most part this site is going to be a place for me to show off my various endeavors, projects, and attempts at different hobbies. You'll also find links to various platforms I'm present on in the footer. Besides that there might not be a whole lot, but regardless I hope you enjoy your visit!</p>
				<h2>This site is currently under construction!</h2>
				<p> So please don't mind the mess for the time being d: </p>

					<p>What to say, what to say? Well, as I like to write in my bio sometimes, I've got waaaay too many interests, and not enough time to properly get into all of them.  I practice archery, though I am a bit rusty compared to my college years. But I'm slowly getting better again. I loved LEGO as a kid and still do! As a result of my interest in LEGO I also am into model kits, from any franchise really. I've got a small collection of figures, though small is probably an understatement to any person who doesn't collect. But I don't aim to collect anything in particular. It's all stuff from different shows and franchises that I like across anime, comics, video games and stuff.</p>

					<p>I also love Sci-Fi! For the longest time it was mainly Star Wars, but I've got a finger in just about every franchise from Star Trek to Halo to Dune to Warhammer 40K. Along with Sci-Fi is my love for fantasy as well. Honestly, I'm probably just an all around nerd. So if there's a property that nerds would be into, there's a good chance that it would at minimum pique my interest. And I can't forget to mention Anime, I am not quite the type to keep up with the popular shows of the day, but I do have a long list of shows I want to eventually watch. I don't just consume media though, I have a couple of short story and character ideas bouncing around in my head that started out as fan fiction stuff, but have eventually turned into ideas separate from their inspiration. Still a couple of fan fiction-y type things though, I do love my OCs haha.</p>

					<p>As a result of being a nerd as a kid and continuing to be a nerd now, I pursued an education in Engineering. My degree is in Mechatronics, which is a field covering Automation, Embedded Systems, and Robotics. It's pretty darn cool, and is equal parts hands on and theoretical. Or, at least it was at my university. Thanks to it being very hands on though, I've got a lot of electrical components and a couple of microcontrollers left over from labs that I like to try and tinker with. Though I'm a touch ashamed to admit I haven't done that as much as I would like to since getting  out of school. </p>
					
					<p>Well, that's about the gist of stuff I think it's worth knowing about me off the bat. <br>Thanks for readin' my little write up! ^-^</p>
